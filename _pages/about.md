Hi,

Welcome to my online home.

I am enthusiastic about robotics, control theory, estimation theory, machine learning and all the relevant mathematical concepts.

I am building this space as my second brain, to document my knowledge:

- Non-technical in the form of [essays](/essays), and
- Technical in the form of [research-notes](/researchnotes).

A list of my academic publications can be found in the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5CrPqpwAAAAJ&hl=en) page or the [publications](/publications) page.

An outline of my professional journey can be found in my [CV](/assets/pdf/PraveenCV.pdf).

#### Bio

I am a postdoctoral researcher working on methods for probabilistic long-term prediction of ship trajectories and collision avoidance systems for autonomous ships as a part of the project [Autosit](https://www.ntnu.edu/autosit/).

I obtained my
- PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Porto, Portugal in July 2019,
- MSc in Systems and Control from Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands in August 2015.
- Bachelors in Electronics and Communication from Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology, India in July 2010.

Feel free to connect with me through socials mentioned below.
